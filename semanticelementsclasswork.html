            <p> Mikey is slightly problematic. He eats binders and folders, he wags his tail too hard and knocks over stuff on coffee tables, and he has a doggy door leading out to our backyard but he refuses to use it. He also has a whole room and a beat up chair from GoodWill to himself, so he's a little spoiled.</p>
            
            <p> Despite all of shortcomings, he is a good boy. He always makes everyone he meets laugh and smile. He is adorable and fluffy. He also is a trained service dog and is a show dog. He alsways gets blue ribbons. He gets along with the horses and other animals we have on the proporty, and he loves swimming in our lake. He also has this towwell that he carries around like a comfort blanket which is really cute. </p>
